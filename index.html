        My name is Jordan Robinson, and I am a student learning the art and
        science of frontend web development. I am passionate about this field
        and eager to learn more every day. As a beginner, I am excited to
        explore the many possibilities that frontend web development offers. I
        am confident that with my hard work and dedication, I will be able to
        create beautiful and functional websites that meet the needs of my
        clients.
