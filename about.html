      <h3>
        Hello there! I'm <span class="myname">Jordan Robinson</span>, and I'm
        fueled by a deep passion for technology and science. From the latest
        breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to the mysteries of the cosmos,
        I find it all fascinating and love delving into the realms of knowledge
        that these subjects offer.

        <h3>
          I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring my web
          development projects to life. Crafting digital experiences and seeing
          my code come alive on the web is both a challenge and a source of
          immense satisfaction for me. Whether it's building websites or
          experimenting with new coding techniques, I relish every moment of it.
          Life is a constant journey of learning and discovery, and I'm on a
          quest to soak up as much knowledge as I can along the way. If you
          share any of these interests or simply want to chat about technology,
          science, books, or coding, feel free to connect with me. Let's embark
          on this exciting journey of exploration and growth together!

          My taste in literature is as diverse as my interests, ranging from the
          enchanting wizardry of Harry Potter to the epic adventures of Star
          Wars, and from the spine-tingling tales of Stephen King to the
          captivating fantasy realms crafted by R.A. Salvatore. There's just
          something magical about getting lost in a well-narrated story.
